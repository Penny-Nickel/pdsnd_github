### Bikeshare project created on 10/6/22 and README file created 10/22/22.

### Udacity BikeShare Project - Programming for Data Science with Python

### In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Code was used to import the data and answer questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. Script was writted to also take in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics. 

In this project, data was provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United States, to uncover bike share usage patterns. 


### Files used include new_york_city.csv, chicago.csv, and washington.csv
